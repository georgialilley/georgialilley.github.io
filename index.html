      <h2>About.</h2>

      <p>Letters to Lockdown is a online exhibition created and collated during the arduous weeks of lockdown in Melbourne, Australia in 2020. It is a collection of many small moments captured over the past few months from contributors all over greater Melbourne. The content has been categorised and dedicated to the rollercoaster of moods endured throughout the period of social isolation.<br><br>

      As a whole, the archive is a platform for distributing, interacting with and reflecting on the turbulent, challenging and contemplative time we’ve experienced. It’s also an open invitation for more Melbournians to contribute their thoughts and experiences.<br><br>

      I hope you find comfort and familiarity within the pages of this site and can use the collection as inspiration to reflect on your thoughts this year. So take your time to meander through this collection of moments.<br><br>

      Letters to Lockdown is an exhibition curated and published by Melbourne Design Student Georgia Lilley in October 2020.</p>
